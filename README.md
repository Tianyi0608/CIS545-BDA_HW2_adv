Page rank and greedy approach (two different parts)
1. Load data and wrangle it(create schema, structure, clean data)
2. Write page rank algorithm and do page rank
3. Remove self-loop and run page rank
4. Load yelp data
5. Use a greedy approach to find out the minimum number of unique reviewers needed to review half of the restaurants (greedy approach: First find the user with most reviews from subset_review_graph, then remove all the businesses they reviewed and repeat the process.)
